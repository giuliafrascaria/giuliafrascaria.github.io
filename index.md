Welcome to my tech hub, it's Giulia :) Italian in Amsterdam.

I work with the [atLarge](https://atlarge-research.com/) research group and we like to play with all things [distributed] systems. My current research focus is on storage for edge computing, and broadly speaking my research interests are in all things low-level, hardware accelerators, operating systems and kernel programming, high performance storage and networking.
