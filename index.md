## Hello World!

Giulia Frascaria

Everything low-level

## /whoami

I come from Italy but am the worst cook ever.
Currently studying in Amsterdam, working on my thesis project for the M.Sc. in Computer Systems Security.

## /whatido 

Good question. I study everything I can. Madly In love with being a beginner, always learning

Ok a bit more specifically, I like kernel headaches although they probably don't like me all that much. Working on my M.Sc. thesis, trying hard to develop an eBPF extension for programmable storage

Also I practice capoeira and I think that's funny because I'm scared of even doing a cartwheel
